`ktunnel` gives you easy port-forward access to your cellular-connected devices behind the Konekt firewall, without the need to set up VPN infrastructure. 

Why is this better than simply opening up ports to the public Internet? Simple: for security reasons, and so that bots cannot chew through your cellular data.
